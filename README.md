## üîê My Cybersecurity Journey

- Studying **network security**, **Linux**, and **threat detection**
- Building a **home lab** with Kali Linux, Windows 10 VMs, and tools like Wireshark, Nmap, and Splunk
- Completing hands-on platforms like:
  - [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com) ‚Äì *Pre-Security*, *SOC Level 1*
  - [Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.com) ‚Äì starting beginner labs
- Currently working toward:
  - ISC2 **Certified in Cybersecurity (CC)** *(in progress)*
  - **CompTIA Security+** *(in progress)*
  - **Google Cybersecurity Certificate** *(in progress)*
