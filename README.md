This repository documents my step-by-step journey into cybersecurity, starting from zero experience. Each week includes notes, hands-on labs, TryHackMe progress, and personal reflections.

## 📆 Week 1 Summary
- ✅ Set up home lab (VirtualBox, Kali Linux, Windows 10)
- ✅ Learned basic networking concepts (OSI model, ports, DNS, IP)
- ✅ Completed initial TryHackMe rooms on the Pre-Security path
- ✅ Took detailed notes and saved progress here

## 🚀 Current Focus
Building strong fundamentals in networking, Linux, and cybersecurity tools. Following TryHackMe’s “Pre-Security” and “Intro to Cyber Security” paths.
