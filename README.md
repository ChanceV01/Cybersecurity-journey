# Hi there, I'm Chance Vilardo!

Aspiring **Cybersecurity Analyst** on a mission to transition into **penetration testing**. I’m currently learning by doing — building out home labs, working through blue/red team labs on TryHackMe and Hack The Box, and studying for industry certifications.

---

## 🔐 My Cybersecurity Journey

- Studying **network security**, **Linux**, and **threat detection**
- Building a **home lab** with Kali Linux, Windows 10 VMs, and tools like Wireshark, Nmap, and Splunk
- Completing hands-on platforms like:
  - [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com) – *Pre-Security*, *SOC Level 1*
  - [Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.com) – starting beginner labs
- Currently working toward:
  - ISC2 **Certified in Cybersecurity (CC)** *(in progress)*
  - **CompTIA Security+** *(in progress)*
  - **Google Cybersecurity Certificate** *(in progress)*

## 🧪 Projects & Labs

- **SOC Simulation** – Triaged alerts and escalated incidents in simulated environments  
- **Penetration Testing Lab** – Practicing enumeration, exploitation, and privilege escalation in a safe home lab  
- **Incident Response Playbook** – Wrote a basic IR guide for phishing and brute-force attempts  
- **Wireshark Analysis** – Identified insecure protocols and documented suspicious behavior from packet captures  

---

## 🚀 Goals

- Land my first **cybersecurity role** in a blue team or SOC environment  
- Continue leveling up toward a **penetration tester** role  
- Share my progress, notes, and labs publicly to help others break in  
- Never stop learning — always hacking, always documenting

------# Cybersecurity Journey – Week 1 & 2

---

## 🔹 Week 1: Foundations of Cybersecurity & Networking

### ✅ Topics Learned:
- What cybersecurity is and why it matters
- Common cyber threats: malware, phishing, ransomware, DDoS
- How the internet works (IP, DNS, HTTP, routers, switches)
- OSI Model basics and how data flows through a network

### 🔧 Labs Completed:
- TryHackMe:
  - [What is Cyber Security?](https://tryhackme.com/room/whatiscybersecurity)
  - [How the Internet Works](https://tryhackme.com/room/howtheinternetworks)
  - [Cyber Threats](https://tryhackme.com/room/cyberthreats)
- Google Cybersecurity Certificate (Getting Started)

### 🧠 Reflections:
The first week gave me a solid understanding of how attackers operate and what defenders are protecting. Learning the basics of networking and threats helped me connect the dots between theory and real-world scenarios.

## 🔹 Week 2: Linux Fundamentals & Terminal Skills

### ✅ Topics Learned:
- Navigating the Linux terminal (bash shell basics)
- File and directory management: `ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`, `rm`, `touch`
- Viewing and editing files with `cat`, `nano`, `chmod`
- Understanding the Linux file system (/, /home, /etc)
- Why Linux is critical for cybersecurity work

### 🔧 Labs Completed:
- TryHackMe:
  - [Introduction to Linux](https://tryhackme.com/room/linuxfundamentals1)
  - [Linux Terminal Basics](https://tryhackme.com/room/linuxfundamentals2) *(optional add-on)*

### 💻 Commands Practiced:
```bash
pwd
ls -la
cd /home
mkdir test_folder
touch hello.txt
nano hello.txt
rm hello.txt
chmod +x script.sh
