├── README.md# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Journey – From Zero to Hero

This repository documents my step-by-step journey into cybersecurity, starting from zero experience. Each week includes notes, hands-on labs, TryHackMe progress, and personal reflections.

## 📆 Week 1 Summary
- ✅ Set up home lab (VirtualBox, Kali Linux, Windows 10)
- ✅ Learned basic networking concepts (OSI model, ports, DNS, IP)
- ✅ Completed initial TryHackMe rooms on the Pre-Security path
- ✅ Took detailed notes and saved progress here

## 🚀 Current Focus
Building strong fundamentals in networking, Linux, and cybersecurity tools. Following TryHackMe’s “Pre-Security” and “Intro to Cyber Security” paths.

## ✅ Tools Installed
- VirtualBox 7.0
- Kali Linux 2023.4 (x64)
- Windows 10 Evaluation VM (from Microsoft)

## 🔧 Virtual Machine Configuration
- **Kali Linux**
  - RAM: 4 GB
  - Disk: 25 GB
  - Network: NAT + Host-only adapter
- **Windows 10**
  - RAM: 4 GB
  - Network: NAT

## 💡 Notes
- Kali comes with tools pre-installed like Nmap, Wireshark, Metasploit.
- Snapshots created for rollback after tests.
- Plan to simulate attacks on Windows VM using Kali tools.

## OSI Model (7 Layers)
1. Physical – Cables, hardware
2. Data Link – MAC address, switches
3. Network – IP, routers
4. Transport – TCP/UDP, ports
5. Session – Session management
6. Presentation – Encryption, compression
7. Application – HTTP, DNS, etc.

## Common Ports
| Port | Service |
|------|---------|
| 80   | HTTP    |
| 443  | HTTPS   |
| 21   | FTP     |
| 22   | SSH     |
| 53   | DNS     |
| 25   | SMTP    |

## Other Concepts
- **IP Addressing:** IPv4, Subnetting
- **DNS:** Resolves domain names to IPs
- **Firewalls:** Control inbound/outbound traffic
- **NAT:** Maps private IPs to public
